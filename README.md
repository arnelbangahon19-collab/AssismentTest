# Checkout Page Demo

This is a pixel-perfect checkout page built with plain **HTML + CSS (Flexbox + Grid)**.  
It was created for a front-end task and shows responsive layout, form input states, order summary, and CTA button states.

No external libraries or frameworks were used. Only minimal JavaScript is included to demonstrate UI state changes (e.g., form validation, order summary toggle).
