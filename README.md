# Checkout Page Demo

This is a pixel-perfect checkout page built with plain **HTML + CSS (Flexbox + Grid)**.  
It was created for a front-end task and shows responsive layout, form input states, order summary, and CTA button states.

ðŸ‘‰ [Live Demo on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/arnelbangahon19-collab/AssismentTest/blob/main/Frontend%20Developer-Assessment-Test/checkoutPage.html)

No external libraries or frameworks were used. Only minimal JavaScript is included to demonstrate UI state changes (e.g., form validation, order summary toggle).
